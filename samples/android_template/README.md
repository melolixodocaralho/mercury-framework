Android template (benign)

This folder contains a minimal placeholder structure for an Android app that
is safe and intended for emulator testing only. It does NOT contain any
backdoor or exploit code. Use Android Studio or `gradle` to build and install
on an emulator.

Structure

- `app/` - placeholder for Android Studio project files (not included). Replace with your own sample project.

Build (example)

- Open Android Studio and create a new empty Activity project.
- Replace package name and resources as needed.
- Build the APK and install with `adb install -r path/to/app-debug.apk` on a running emulator.

Note: this is a template for benign sample apps used for detection testing and training.
