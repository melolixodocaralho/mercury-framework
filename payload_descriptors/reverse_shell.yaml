description: |
  A reverse shell is a connection where a target machine initiates an outbound
  connection to a controller and provides a shell over that connection. This
  descriptor is educational only and contains no implementation code.

indicators:
  - outbound_connection_to_unusual_host
  - use_of_nc_with_-e_or_-c
  - spawning_of_/bin/sh_or_/bin/bash_by_untypical_process
  - suspicious_command_line_arguments

detection_points:
  - monitor_outbound_connections_and_associate_processes
  - inspect_command_line_invocations_for_shell_invocations
  - network_signatures_for_known_tools (e.g., netcat, socat)

mitigations:
  - restrict_outbound_traffic_by_policy
  - use_egress_firewalls_and_proxy_authentication
  - apply_endpoint_monitoring_and_process_whitelisting
  - educate_admins_on_incident_response

responsible_use: |
  This descriptor is for educational and defensive use only. Do not implement
  or deploy reverse shells against systems you do not own or have explicit
  permission to test. Use this descriptor to build detection and prevention rules.
